# Xamarin Studio add-in for MvvmCross solutions

This installs project templates for creating MvvmCross solutions. This allows you to create a new native Xamarin project targetting iOS and Android using either Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, or using Xamarin.Forms.

This creates a solution with 3 projects:

* A Core PCL containing a view model (or creating your views if you are using the Forms template)
* An iOS project
* An Android project

This add-in is available in the Stable add-in repository in Xamarin Studio, or online in the [MonoDevelop add-in repo](http://addins.monodevelop.com/Project/Index/227)
